 # 50 SQL Query Questions and Answers for Practice
SQL Interview | By Meenakshi Agarwal
If you want to improve SQL skills, then install a SQL package like MySQL and start practicing with it. To get you started, we‚Äôve outlined a few SQL query questions in this post.

Solving practice questions is the fastest way to learn any subject. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve selected a set of 50 SQL queries that you can use to step up your learning. We‚Äôve also given SQL scripts to create the test data. So, you can use them to create a test database and tables.

Most of the SQL query questions we‚Äôve filtered out of interviews held by top IT MNC like Flipkart and Amazon. So you‚Äôll gain real-time experience by going through them.

Also, we recommend that you first try to form queries by yourself rather than just reading them from the post. Try to find answers on your own.

But you can‚Äôt start until the required sample data is not in place. You can check out the tables below that we‚Äôve provided for practice. So first of all, you need to create the test data in your database software.

By the way, we have a bunch of other posts available for SQL interview preparation. So if you are interested, then follow the link given below.

To prepare the sample data, you can run the following queries in your database query executor or on the SQL command line. We‚Äôve tested them with MySQL Server 5.7 and MySQL Workbench 6.3.8 query browser. You can also download these Softwares and install them to carry on the SQL exercise.
